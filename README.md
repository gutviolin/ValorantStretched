# ValorantStretched

Valorant stretched toolkit

Script to automate valorant true stretched config

# How to use:

install dependencies

pip install pyuac

pip install pypiwin32

Edit your file path in ValorantFill.py

Likely the following

path = "C:\\Users\\<YOUR PC USER NAME HERE>\\AppData\\Local\\VALORANT\\Saved\\Config\\*\\Windows\\GameUserSettings.ini"

Chose your resolution and edit ValorantFill.py accordingly (1440x1080 default)

Change resolution in windows to desired 4:3 res

Run ValorantFill before opening the game

Run ApplyNoBorder.bat after opening the game (should only need to do this once)

All accounts that have been logged into locally will have their config files updated with new res. (so switching accounts keeps your stretched setup)
